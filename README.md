## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am a Senior CAE and Applied Research Engineer with 10+ years of experience in crashworthiness, NVH, durability, and composite simulation for automotive, aerospace, and nuclear applications.

My expertise lies in physics-based modeling, CAE automation, and ML-assisted simulation workflows. I specialize in correlating numerical predictions with experimental results and certification requirements.

My PhD research focuses on vibroacoustic and structural behavior of functionally graded composite plates under dynamic loading. I have published 9+ SCI/SCIE Q1/Q2 journal papers in the areas of vibroacoustics, composites, bolted joints, and lightweight materials.
